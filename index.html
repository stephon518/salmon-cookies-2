        My favorite cookies in the whole wide world are these oatmeal raisin cookies. They’re a little chewy in the center and a little crispy at the edges. Each bite is loaded with oats and sweet bursts of raisins.

        My grandmother used to bake oatmeal raisin cookies with me from the time I was old enough to stand on a chair and hold a spoon. Making these cookies taught me how to measure, how scrape down the sides of a mixing bowl, and the purest pleasure of all—licking the bowl.

        Whoever helped with the cooking got first dibs on the bowl, so guess who was the first to volunteer to help? YOU DONT NEED NO DUNKIN DONUTS!

        No cookie says Christmas more than a gingerbread cookie, right? They’re fun to make, fun to decorate, and even more fun to eat.

        Years ago when I first started experimenting with gingerbread men recipes, I made one truly terrible batch from a recipe in my favorite 1974 edition of the Joy of Cooking. That recipe called for 1/4 cup of butter and 3 1/2 cups of flour, and the result, as you might expect, had more structure than taste.

        My guess is that the Joy cookie was originally developed to be a tree ornament, and while there is nothing wrong with cookie tree ornaments, I wanted gingerbread men and women I could EAT.
